            "content_text": "Cas9 is a DNA endonuclease guided by two RNAs. Cas9, the hallmark protein of type II systems, has been hypothesized to be involved in both crRNA maturation and crRNA-guided DNA interference (fig. S1) ( 4 , 25 -27 ). Cas9 is involved in crRNA maturation ( 4 ), but its direct participation in target DNA destruction has not been investigated. To test whether and how Cas9 might be capable of target DNA cleavage, we used an overexpression system to purify Cas9 protein derived from the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (fig. S2, see supplementary materials and methods) and tested its ability to cleave a plasmid DNA or an oligonucleotide duplex bearing a protospacer sequence complementary to a mature crRNA, and a bona fide PAM. We found that mature crRNA alone was incapable of directing Cas9-catalyzed plasmid DNA cleavage (Fig. 1A and fig. S3A). However, addition of tracrRNA, which can pair with the repeat sequence of crRNA and is essential to crRNA maturation in this system,triggeredCas9tocleaveplasmidDNA(Fig. 1A and fig. S3A). The cleavage reaction required both magnesium and the presence of a crRNA sequence complementary to the DNA; a crRNA capable of tracrRNA base pairing but containing a noncognate target DNA-binding sequence did not support Cas9-catalyzed plasmid cleavage (Fig. 1A; fig. S3A, compare crRNA-sp2 to crRNA-sp1; and fig. S4A). We obtained similar results with a short linear dsDNA substrate (Fig. 1B and fig. S3, B and C). Thus, the trans-activating tracrRNA is a small noncoding RNA with two critical functions: triggering pre-crRNA processing by the enzyme RNase III ( 4 ) and subsequently activating crRNA-guided DNA cleavage by Cas9.",

We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.",

CRISPR/Cas-mediated immunity occurs in three steps. In the adaptive phase, bacteria and archaea harboring one or more CRISPR loci respond to viral or plasmid challenge by integrating short fragments of foreign sequence (protospacers) into the host chromosome at the proximal end of the CRISPR array ( 1 -3 ).

In contrast, type II systems process precrRNAs by a different mechanism in which a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) complementary to the repeat sequences in pre-crRNA triggers processing by the double-stranded (ds) RNAspecific ribonuclease RNase III in the presence of the Cas9 (formerly Csn1) protein (fig.

Plasmid DNA cleavage produced blunt ends at a position three base pairs upstream of the PAM sequence (Fig. 1, C and E, and fig. S5, A and C) ( 26 ). Similarly, within short dsDNA duplexes, the DNA strand that is complementary to the target-binding sequence in the crRNA (the complementary strand) is cleaved at a site three base pairs upstream of the PAM (Fig. 1, D and E, and fig. S5, B and C). The noncomplementary DNA strand is cleaved at one or more sites within three to eight base pairs upstream of the PAM. Further investigation revealed that the noncomplementary strand is first cleaved endonucleolytically and subsequently trimmed by a 3 ' -5 ' exonuclease activity (fig. S4B). The cleavage rates by Cas9 under single-turnover conditions ranged from 0.3 to 1min -1 , comparable to those of restriction endonucleases (fig. S6A), whereas incubation of wildtype (WT) Cas9-tracrRNA:crRNA complex with a fivefold molar excess of substrate DNA provided evidence that the dual-RNA -guided Cas9 is a multiple-turnover enzyme (fig.

            "content_text": "Dual-RNA requirements for target DNA binding and cleavage. tracrRNA might be required for target DNA binding and/or to stimulate the nuclease activity of Cas9 downstream of target recognition. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to monitor target DNA binding by catalytically inactive Cas9 in the presence or absence of crRNA and/or tracrRNA. Addition of tracrRNA substantially enhanced target DNA binding by Cas9, whereas we observed little specific DNA binding with Cas9 alone or Cas9-crRNA (fig. S9). This indicates that tracrRNA is required for target DNA recognition, possibly by properly orienting the crRNA for interaction with the complementary strand of target DNA. The predicted tracrRNA:crRNA secondary structure includes base pairing between the 22 nucleotides at the 3Ã¢â‚¬Â² terminus of the crRNA and a segment near the 5Ã¢â‚¬Â² end of the mature tracrRNA (Fig. 1E). This interaction creates a structure in which the 5Ã¢â‚¬Â²-terminal 20 nucleotides of the crRNA, which vary in sequence in different crRNAs, are available for target DNA binding. The bulk of the tracrRNA downstream of the crRNA basepairing region is free to form additional RNA structure(s) and/or to interact with Cas9 or the target DNA site. To determine whether the entire length of the tracrRNA is necessary for sitespecific Cas9-catalyzed DNA cleavage, we tested Cas9-tracrRNA:crRNA complexes reconstituted using full-length mature (42-nucleotide) crRNA",
